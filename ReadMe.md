# Move files into date directories

[This PowerShell script](src/MoveFilesIntoDateDirectories.ps1) will scan all files in the `SourceDirectoryPath` and then move them into directories whose name is based on the file's date.
Target directories will be created if they doesn't already exist, using a name based upon the `TargetDirectoriesDateScope`, and they will be created within the `TargetDirectoryPath`.
